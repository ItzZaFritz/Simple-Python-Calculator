# Python Calculator

This is a simple Python project that acts as a calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations. It's designed for beginners learning programming and Python syntax.

## What It Does

This calculator lets the user perform 7 different math operations by choosing from a menu:

1. **Addition**: Adds two numbers  
2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first  
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers  
4. **Division**: Divides the first number by the second  
5. **Whole Division**: Divides and returns only the whole number part  
6. **Modulus**: Returns the remainder of the division  
7. **Exponentiation**: Raises the first number to the power of the second  

## How It Works

The script:

- Displays all 7 operations to the user
- Asks for two numbers
- Asks for the operation symbol (like `+` or `**`)
- Calculates and prints the result
